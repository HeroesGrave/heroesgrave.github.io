### How to Play:
- Left/Right arrows to move.
- Up to jump.
- _Hold_ space to attack.
- Down arrow to use special attack. (has cooldown)

To respawn, press key 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to which unit you want to spawn as.

1 = Warrior  
2 = Archer  
3 = Assassin  

Collect coins dropped by enemies and store them in your chest.

With 50 coins in the chest, you can press **H** to heal.  
With 150, you can summon an additional guardian, using the same controls as for respawning (_see above_)

There is no way to win or lose. Just try to survive as long as possible.  
When your tower is overrun by goblins it is a good time to give up.
