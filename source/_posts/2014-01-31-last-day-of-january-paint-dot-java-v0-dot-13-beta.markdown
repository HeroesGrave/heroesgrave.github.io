Yay!

### Selection System Overhaul:

- Changes are now clipped against the selection region, so selection can be used as a mask.
- Fixed lots of selection-related bugs.
- Ellipse selection (still a bit buggy).
- Cut/Copy/Paste with cross-application compatibility (I think. It works in GIMP).
- Arrow keys move the mouse one pixel, relative to the zoom of the canvas. Ctrl+Arrow keys to move 8 pixels.

There isn't much left to do before 1.0. I believe someone is working on the tools dialog, which leaves me to clean things up,
sort out the history, finalise the plugin system, and make some icons.

Of course if you want to help with any of those or add new tools etc. to get your name in the credits, feel free.
Just post in the appropriate issue on Github or make one if it doesn't exist. We don't want 2 people working on the same thing.
