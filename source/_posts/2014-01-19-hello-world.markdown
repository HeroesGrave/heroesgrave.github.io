### Welcome to my new blog/website!

Special thanks to [Github](http://github.com/) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) for their services that enable me to do this.

For those who are new to my work, I previously had (and for now, still have) a blog with Tumblr (which can be found [here](http://heroesgravedevelopment.tumblr.com/)),
but I have been looking for alternatives as Tumblr is full of junk which gets in the way of me blogging.

I will probably keep the Tumblr blog going for a little while longer, while I test out the features of Octopress/Github Pages, but it will not last forever.

**Okay, let me introduce myself:**

I am HeroesGrave (_not_ my real name, just a pseudonym).

As `HeroesGrave`, I am a game developer.  
As `!HeroesGrave`, I am a gamer.

My skills lie primarily in programming, but my pixel art is improving, and although I haven't tried to yet,
I have been brought up musically, so hopefully I can make some decent audio.

I guess I also design games too, but that doesn't take much effort, and in the case of indie game development, is usually covered by programming anyway.  

I support and enjoy taking part in hacker culture (_Not cracker. See [here](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/C/cracker.html/)_).

I hate Apple more than Microsoft.  
I hate Microsoft more than Apple. <sup><sub>_Despite the semi-paradoxical joke, I hate Microsoft a little bit more._</sub></sup>  
In general, I hate anything that takes people's freedom away.

I love Linux.  
I love the Free Software movement, and when in the right place, the Open Source movement too.  
(for those who don't know the difference, [see this](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.en.html))

I am very familiar with Java (my first and primary language), have just about learned [Rust](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/),
can read but not write code in C/C++, and can generally understand what a (sane) piece of code does in most common programming languages.

### Notable Projects
