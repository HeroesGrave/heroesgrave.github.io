Today I sat down and started work on v0.12. All the work between 0.11 and 0.12 was done in one day. It was fun.

### Screenshot:

### Features:

- Image selection. S to select. M to move. Not quite complete, but more functionality will be coming for the next version.
- Layered image format. LBIN for raw uncompressed data. ZLBIN for the compressed version. Both take about the same time to load/save, but ZLBIN is way smaller.
