### Features:

- Global History, as opposed to several layer-specific histories. Less confusion, better undo/redo.
- Layer functions are now recorded in the history.
- All functions have finally been reimplemented with the new drawing system. (This really only effects Resize and Canvas Resize)
- Compacted the menus.
- Lots of minor fixes.
