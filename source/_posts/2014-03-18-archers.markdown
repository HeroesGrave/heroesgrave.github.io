A little, bit late (Tuesday), but here is what I was going to post for Screenshot Saturday:

As well as implementing Archers, there have been a lot of AI tweaks and rebalances.
Although in the sequence above only the archers survive, usually it's a more even spread of units.

A little bit of work is needed to have units respawning properly (ATM it just spawns warriors at random intervals),
and when that's done, I'll create a few levels and throw up a demo.
