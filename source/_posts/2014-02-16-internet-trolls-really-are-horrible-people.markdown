Haven't posted in a little while due to school just starting, but then I found this article on [HN](http://news.ycombinator.com), and had to share.

## [Internet Trolls Really Are Horrible People](http://http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/climate_desk/2014/02/internet_troll_personality_study_machiavellianism_narcissism_psychopathy.html)

Okay, so stating the obvious to start with, but they have actually proved it... **WITH SCIENCE!**
<sup>(Sound more like statistics to me, but whatever)</sup>

It mentions how trolls are actually a _very_ small minority, and that most people don't even comment.

> To be sure, only 5.6 percent of survey respondents actually specified that they enjoyed “trolling.”
By contrast, 41.3 percent of Internet users were “non-commenters,”
meaning they didn’t like engaging online at all.
So trolls are, as has often been suspected, a minority of online commenters,
and an even smaller minority of overall Internet users.

So next time you get trolled, you know that you aren't hated by everyone. Good to know.  
Although this brings up a new issue, which I'll talk about later.

I recommend reading the whole article, as some of the stuff is quite interesting.  
But if you're too lazy, here's my summary:

> The research ... sought to directly investigate whether people who engage in trolling are
characterized by personality traits that fall in the so-called Dark Tetrad:
Machiavellianism (willingness to manipulate and deceive others),
narcissism (egotism and self-obsession),
psychopathy (the lack of remorse and empathy),
and sadism (pleasure in the suffering of others).  
...  
[Trolling] was correlated with sadism in its various forms, with psychopathy, and with Machiavellianism.
Overall, the authors found that the relationship between sadism and trolling was the strongest,
and that indeed, sadists appear to troll because they find it pleasurable.

And now the issue I mentioned earlier:

### People need to act out against this behaviour

**If trolls are the minority, then why are we letting them bully people?**

Yes, it's bullying. They say _"just for teh lulz"_, but we know that they are only satisfied by hurting people.

One of the worst places I've seen for trolling is the indie game-dev community.

Countless developers have been making games for other people's enjoyment, sometimes even at their own cost.
But even there trolls do their horrific work and many developers quit because of the seeming hopelessness of the situation.

What needs to happen is that **we, the majority**, need to speak out.  
We need to fight back against trolls. Make them know that they are disgusting, and then throw them out of the community in disgrace.
It's unacceptable behaviour and everyone knows it.

But more importantly, we need to give more encouragement to the people affected.
Once a developer has quit, it's usually too late to say _"Don't give up now"_.

**You** need to take the time to say _"Great work"_ when you like their work, and give constructive criticism when something needs improvement.
And if you don't like the game, don't make a big fuss about it (unless it qualifies as a scam etc.).  
**It's not the developer's fault you don't like it.**

Finally, don't be a troll. If you find yourself only thinking about yourself, or wanting to hurt others, you need to take a _long break_ from the internet.

Thanks for reading my confused ramblings.
