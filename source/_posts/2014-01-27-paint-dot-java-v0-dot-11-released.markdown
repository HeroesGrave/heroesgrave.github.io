Special thanks to [Longor1996](https://github.com/Longor1996), who did nearly all the work for this version, as I was away camping.

### Features:

- New colour chooser dialog. Longor1996 did an amazing job. It's not 100% complete yet, but is fully functional.
- Colour palettes for the aforementioned colour chooser. I'm not entirely sure how they work, but when I find out, I'll document it.
- Dark background mode (visible in the screenshot). Makes working with light colours easier.
- A few minor GUI fixes and tweaks, plus some new icons.
