    <p>Hi. I'm HeroesGrave (<em>not</em> my real name, a pseudonym).</p>
<p>I develop games (or at least attempt to). Most of that is programming and design, but I can do some okay pixel art, and I occasionally write some soundtrack music. I'm also in my second year of studying Compsci and Maths for my BSc.</p>

<p>I first got into programming when I was 13 by modding Minecraft. Never made anything useful, but eventually I discovered the awesome community at <a href="https://java-gaming.org">java-gaming.org</a>, and started learning how to write my own games from scratch. That was over 6 years ago. I made a lot of cool prototypes over that time (well, at least <em>I</em> thought they were cool), but never really finished a game of reasonable complexity.</p>

<p>About 3 and a half years ago, I was looking for a lower-level language to expand my skillset, and through some luck, discovered <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> while it was at version 0.8. It took quite a while to learn, but was definitely worth it. I authored <a href="https://github.com/HeroesGrave/ecs-rs">ecs-rs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HeroesGrave/fixedstep-rs">fixedstep-rs</a>. I haven't written any projects in Java for quite some time now, although I did mess around a bit with Kotlin and JavaFX.</p>

<p>I've participated in a few <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dares</a> over the last few years. I usually suffer from spending too much time on mechanics and not enough on polishing, resulting in a fun game that nobody can understand how to play. Lately I've sort-of stopped bothering with LDs, due to the decline in theme quality (okay, let's be honest: most of them aren't even themes).</p>
<p>Currently I'm working on a few libraries in Rust, including a cache-friendly &amp; parallel rewrite of ecs-rs, as well as a simple GUI toolkit for use with OpenGL applications (ie: games).</p>
<p>Anyway, that's me, for those few people who bothered to dig this far through my blog.</p>
